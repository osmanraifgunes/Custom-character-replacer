Relace non-latin characters to latin equivalent in a string

There are special characters (Ậ, Ş, Æ, Ť, Ü) used in some languages In some alphabets like Vietnamese, Turkish,etc.

Moreover, there are special characters inside string like ®, {, %, etc.

I used this to generate seo-friendly url from text. This script may be used for some special operations like clear text before printibg, seo, search text , etc.

Used sources to identify characters are :
